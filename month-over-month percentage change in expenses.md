### The formula you provided is a DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) formula used in Power BI for calculating the month-over-month percentage change in expenses. Here's a breakdown of the formula:
#### This Formula also available in power BI
```
Expense MoM% =
IF(
	ISFILTERED('Sheet1'[Date]),
	ERROR("Time intelligence quick measures can only be grouped or filtered by the Power BI-provided date hierarchy or primary date column."),
	VAR __PREV_MONTH =
		CALCULATE(
			SUM('Sheet1'[Expense]),
			DATEADD('Sheet1'[Date].[Date], -1, MONTH)
		)
	RETURN
		DIVIDE(SUM('Sheet1'[Expense]) - __PREV_MONTH, __PREV_MONTH)
)

```
### Let's go through each part of the formula:

* ISFILTERED('Sheet1'[Date]) checks if the 'Date' column from 'Sheet1' is filtered. This is used to ensure that the formula is only applied when the 'Date' column is not filtered.

* If the 'Date' column is filtered, it returns an error message using ERROR("Time intelligence quick measures can only be grouped or filtered by the Power BI-provided date hierarchy or primary date column."). This is to prevent using the formula when the date filtering is not supported.

* If the 'Date' column is not filtered, the formula continues to execute. It defines a variable __PREV_MONTH to store the sum of expenses for the previous month. The CALCULATE function is used to calculate the sum of expenses, and the DATEADD function is used to subtract one month from the 'Date' column value.

* The RETURN statement calculates the month-over-month percentage change by subtracting the previous month's expense total from the current month's expense total and then dividing it by the previous month's expense total using the DIVIDE function.

* In summary, the formula calculates the month-over-month percentage change in expenses by comparing the current month's total expenses with the previous month's total expenses.
